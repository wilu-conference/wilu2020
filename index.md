# Welcome to Halifax!

**WILU 2020 will be hosted by Dalhousie University, Mount Saint Vincent University, and Saint Mary's University in Halifax, NS on May 27 to 29, 2020.**

## WILU 2020: Visions of the Possible

Teaching is, in part, about asking questions. Thoughtful teaching considers questions like “what is happening in this classroom?” and “what works in helping students learn?”  “Visions of the possible,” a phrase borrowed from the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL)[^1], goes further and asks us to ponder “what if?” and avoid making assumptions. Visions of the possible anticipate surprise and embrace the unexpected nature of some of teaching's most important outcomes.

Looking ahead to what might be possible means building on what we do best. Our past and current practices are the foundation from which we build, innovate, and create. To envision the possible, we also draw on the past to reflect, critique, and improve upon the present. What can we envision for the future of information literacy and library instruction? Where have your visions led you? How have your experiences clarified your vision?  WILU 2020 invites you to come together in Halifax to share the practical and applied, theoretical and philosophical possibilities in information literacy.
