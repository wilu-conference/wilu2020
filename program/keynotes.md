#### Teaching as though what mattered most was our learning
In this session, Kim Brooks takes on the hard question of what the university would look like if what we cared about most was learning:  our own and our students’.  Most of us are so pressed by the daily demands of our jobs – real or perceived – that we forget what motivated us to work in a university setting.  The session will be divided into four parts: (1) what we wish we knew; (2) what our students wish we knew; (3) we what wish our students knew; and (4) who we plan to be, perhaps not in that order! *([About Kim Brooks.](/program/speakers#keynote-1))*
